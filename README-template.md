### What I learned

i leant about positioning (css) , grouping a number of HTML objects to be subjected to flex box and also developed and got familiar with flex box.
Also worked on svg manipulation as a result i was able to change fill of svg using css

```css
svg {
  fill:#4C545C;
 }
svg:hover{
  fill:  hsl(171, 66%, 44%);
 }
```




### Continued development

i look forward to applying a few display-grid to my css as i have learnt the rudiments.
